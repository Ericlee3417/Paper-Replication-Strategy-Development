# Alpha Engine Trading Strategy Replication and Optimization

## Overview

This repository contains a Python-based implementation of the **Alpha Engine Trading Strategy**, originally described in the paper "The Alpha Engine: Designing an Automated Trading Algorithm" by Anton Golub, James B. Glattfelder, and Richard B. Olsen. The primary goal of this project is to replicate and optimize the trading strategy, which was initially implemented in Java, by translating the code into Python and making necessary adjustments to enhance its performance in real-world trading scenarios.

## Objectives

- **Replication**: The original strategy has been carefully translated from Java to Python, staying true to the core principles and logic presented in the original paper.
- **Optimization**: The strategy’s parameters have been fine-tuned and adapted to optimize its performance in the forex market, with a focus on robustness and profitability.
- **Transparency**: This project aims to replicate and build upon the work of the original authors, not to claim it as my own. The objective is to demonstrate the strategy’s potential and explore avenues for further enhancement.

## Files and Structure

- **AlphaEngine.py**: The core engine that drives the trading strategy, managing the execution of trades based on the principles of the Alpha Engine.
- **CoastlineTrader.py**: Implements the coastline trading logic, which is central to the Alpha Engine strategy. This includes the handling of long and short positions based on market conditions.
- **LimitOrders.py**: Manages the placement and execution of limit orders within the strategy.
- **LocalLiquidity.py**: Contains the logic for the local liquidity indicator, which adjusts trading behavior based on market conditions.
- **Price.py**: A utility class that handles price data, including bid, ask, and mid prices.
- **Runner.py**: Handles the detection of directional changes and overshoots, which are key signals for the trading strategy.
- **Tools.py**: A collection of utility functions and tools that support the main strategy logic.
- **alpha_main.py**: The main script that integrates all components and runs the trading strategy.
- **test.py**: Contains test cases to ensure the correctness of the implementation.

## Implementation Details

The Python code in this repository is a direct translation of the original Java code, with necessary adjustments to ensure compatibility and performance within the Python ecosystem. The code structure and logic remain faithful to the original design, while Python's computational libraries enhance the efficiency of certain operations.

## Disclaimer

This project is an attempt to replicate and optimize an existing trading strategy for educational and research purposes. The work is not intended to claim originality over the strategy or its components. Instead, it seeks to explore the practical applications of the Alpha Engine in modern trading environments and to provide insights into its potential improvements.
